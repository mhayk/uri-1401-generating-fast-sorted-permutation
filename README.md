Generating Fast, Sorted Permutation

Generating permutation has always been an important problem in computer science. In this problem you will have to generate the permutation of a given string in ascending order. Remember that your algorithm must be efficient.
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n, which indicates how many strings to follow. The next n lines contain n strings. Strings will only contain alphanumeric and never contain any space. The maximum length of the string is 10.
Output

For each input string print all the permutations possible in ascending order. Note that the strings should be treated, as case sensitive strings and no permutation should be repeated. A blank line should follow each output set.
